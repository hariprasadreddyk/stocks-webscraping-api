# stocks-webscraping-api

ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of web scraping techniques to extract real-time financial data from Google Finance â€“ Most Active Stocks.
We specifically targeted the 50 most actively traded public companies, aiming to show practical applications of:

Data collection in financial analytics

Integration with financial APIs

Actionable insights into market behavior

Key metrics collected include:

Company name & stock ticker

Current stock prices & intraday ranges

Trading volume (market interest)

Daily price change & percentage change

ðŸ”¹ Methodology
1. Web Scraping

Source: Google Finance â€“ Most Active Stocks

3. Data Processing

Cleaned and structured data using Pandas

Combined web-scraped + API data into a unified DataFrame

Prepared outputs for further visualization & analysis

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights

Identified stocks with high volatility (potential risk/reward opportunities)

Recognized consistent upward/downward trends (potential entry/exit points)

Built a framework to compare market activity vs. trading performance

ðŸ”¹ Conclusions

By extracting and combining data from Google Finance and TwelveData API, this project:

Offers a comprehensive intraday view of stock price behavior
